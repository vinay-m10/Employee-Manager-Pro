# Employee-Manager-Pro
I developed 'EmployeeManagerPro,' an employee management system built using the MVC architecture. It allows users to add, update, delete, and view employee details via a dynamic web interface. The system also includes a menu for streamlined navigation and incorporates Spring MVC for robust backend logic and MySQL for efficient data management.
